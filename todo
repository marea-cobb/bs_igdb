Changes that still need to be implemented:

- Adding new tables to models.py
    - Clonotype Dictionary
    - Create new upload script for the new tables.

- Adding complex query
    - functionality behind the search
    - I recommend that pre-defined searches are used to limit the user from querying unrelated attributes.

- Front page visualization
    - Add google graphs??

- Documentation!

- Add dynamic ordering (A-Z or Z-A)

- Deploy onto Stamatatos-lx


Testing Requirements:
- regex for all searches
